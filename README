CALCULATE TRADES:
- change "teamStartingPositions" if your team format is different

    phantomjs trade.js 1 1

- the first number is the number of players you are trading
- the second number is the number of players you are getting in the trade.
- So if you wanted to calculate up to 2 x 2 (going higher might take a long time)

    for i in "1 1" "1 2" "2 1" "2 2"; do phantomjs trade.js $i; done
