SCRAPING STATS

- change "username" and "myPassword" global var @ top of downloadplayerprojections.js 
- (uses grep/sed/sort/uniq for linux)

    (cwd is this dir)
    ./scrapeall.sh

- NOTE: current ./final.scraped.txt is up to date as of Aug28 if you just want to skip scraping

CALCULATE TRADES
- change "yourTeamName" global var @ top of trade.js
  - replace any spaces in your name with "_"

    (cwd is this dir)
    phantomjs trade.js 1 1

- the first number is the number of players you are trading
- the second number is the number of players you are getting in the trade.
- So if you wanted to calculate up to 2 x 2 (going higher might take a long time)

    for i in "1 1" "1 2" "2 1" "2 2"; do phantomjs trade.js $i; done
